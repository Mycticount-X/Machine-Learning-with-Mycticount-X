# Machine Learning with Mycticount-X

This repository is a reference implementation inspired by the book **"Python Machine Learning Cookbook"** by **Chris Albon**. The code demonstrates how to work with **NumPy** for data manipulation, a fundamental skill for anyone starting with **Machine Learning** and **Data Science**. If you're a beginner in **Machine Learning** or **Data Science**, I highly recommend reading that book. This book is full of practical recipes for handling real-world datasets and machine learning tasks using **Python**.

## Chapter 1: NumPy

The project showcases the use of **NumPy** for manipulating and processing numerical data efficiently. With techniques introduced in this repository, you will learn how to:
- Use **NumPy arrays** for fast mathematical operations.
- Understand and apply key functions and operations in **NumPy** that are critical in machine learning tasks.

## Chapter 2: Data with SciPy
