# Machine Learning with Mycticount-X

This repository is a reference implementation inspired by the book **"Python Machine Learning Cookbook"** by **Chris Albon**. The code demonstrates how to work with **NumPy** for data manipulation, a fundamental skill for anyone starting with **Machine Learning** and **Data Science**. If you're a beginner in **Machine Learning** or **Data Science**, I highly recommend reading that book. This book is full of practical recipes for handling real-world datasets and machine learning tasks using **Python**.

## Chapter 1: NumPy

The project showcases the use of **NumPy** for manipulating and processing numerical data efficiently. This is the Course Outline
1. Vector and Array
2. Matrix
3. Sparse Matrix
4. Selecting and Slincing Elements
5. Shape, Size, and Dimension
6. Matrix Operation
7. Basic Statistic
8. Matrix Signature
9. Linear Algebra
10. Random Array Generator

## Chapter 2: Data with Scikit-Learn and PyPlot
