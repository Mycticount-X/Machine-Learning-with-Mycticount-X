# Machine Learning with Mycticount-X

This repository is a reference implementation inspired by the book **"Python Machine Learning Cookbook"** by **Chris Albon**. The code demonstrates how to work with Data Handling and Scientific Computing, a fundamental skill for anyone starting with **Machine Learning** and **Data Science**. If you're a beginner in **Machine Learning** or **Data Science**, I highly recommend reading that book. This book is full of practical recipes for handling real-world datasets and machine learning tasks using **Python**.
